# Probe auto-registration
This repository aims to automate the process of registering a probe to brain anatomy on par with manual tracing of signal data, while maintaining reproducibility. 

This is done by fitting probe geometry (loaded from probe interface) to signal data from Dil coated probes (see https://brainglobe.info/tutorials/silicon-probe-tracking.html).
